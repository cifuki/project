matplotlib.pyplot.triplot(*args, **kwargs)

Draw a unstructured triangular grid as lines and/or markers.
The triangulation to plot can be specified in one of two ways; either:
triplot(triangulation, ...)
 
where triangulation is a matplotlib.tri.Triangulation object, or
triplot(x, y, ...)
triplot(x, y, triangles, ...)
triplot(x, y, triangles=triangles, ...)
triplot(x, y, mask=mask, ...)
triplot(x, y, triangles, mask=mask, ...)
 
in which case a Triangulation object will be created. See Triangulation for a explanation of these possibilities.
The remaining args and kwargs are the same as for plot().
Return a list of 2 Line2D containing respectively:
the lines plotted for triangles edges
the markers plotted for triangles nodes
