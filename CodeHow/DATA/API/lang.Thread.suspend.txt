lang.Thread.suspend()\nDeprecated.Â \nThis method has been deprecated, as it is\n   inherently deadlock-prone.  If the target thread holds a lock on the\n   monitor protecting a critical system resource when it is suspended, no\n   thread can access this resource until the target thread is resumed. If\n   the thread that would resume the target thread attempts to lock this\n   monitor prior to calling resume, deadlock results.  Such\n   deadlocks typically manifest themselves as "frozen" processes.\n   For more information, see\n   Why\n   are Thread.stop, Thread.suspend and Thread.resume Deprecated?.\n\n
