io.ObjectInputStream.resolveProxyClass(String[]Â interfaces)\nReturns a proxy class that implements the interfaces named in a proxy\n class descriptor; subclasses may implement this method to read custom\n data from the stream along with the descriptors for dynamic proxy\n classes, allowing them to use an alternate loading mechanism for the\n interfaces and the proxy class.\n
