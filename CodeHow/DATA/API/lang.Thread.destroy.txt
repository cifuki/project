lang.Thread.destroy(). If the target thread held\n     a lock protecting a critical system resource when it was\n     destroyed, no thread could ever access this resource again.\n     If another thread ever attempted to lock this resource, deadlock\n     would result. Such deadlocks typically manifest themselves as\n     "frozen" processes. For more information, see\n     \n     Why are Thread.stop, Thread.suspend and Thread.resume Deprecated?.\n\n
