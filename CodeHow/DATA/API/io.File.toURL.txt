io.File.toURL()\nDeprecated.Â \nThis method does not automatically escape characters that\n are illegal in URLs.  It is recommended that new code convert an\n abstract pathname into a URL by first converting it into a URI, via the\n toURI method, and then converting the URI into a URL\n via the URI.toURL method.\n\n
