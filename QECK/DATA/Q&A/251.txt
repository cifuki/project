Q:Since updating to ADT 14 I can no longer build my project. It was building fine prior to updating. 

The error:

[2011-10-23 16:23:29 - Dex Loader] Unable to execute dex: Multiple dex files define Lcom/myapp/R$array;
[2011-10-23 16:23:29 - myProj] Conversion to Dalvik format failed: Unable to execute dex: Multiple dex files define Lcom/myapp/R$array;


Similar issues have been reported and I have tried the suggestions there including


Restarting Eclipse.
Cleaning the project and rebuild - Disable "Project->Build Automatically" option, then "Clean" and "Build" project, then try to run. reset "Build Automatically" option to On
Re-installing the Android Developer Tools
Re-installing Eclipse (updated to the latest version 3.7.1)
Created a new project importing from the file system
Created a new project from subversion.

A:I had the same problem, quite weird because it was happening only when using Eclipse (but it was OK with Ant).
This is how I fixed it:


Right click on the Project Name
Select Build Path -> Configure Build Path
In Java Build Path, go to the tab Order and Export
Uncheck your .jar library


Only sometimes:
In Order and Export tab I did not have any jar library there, so I have unchecked Android Private Libraries item. Now my project is running.
