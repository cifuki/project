Q:I've always programmed Android with Eclipse and decided to start migrating to Android Studio. I decided to use the same SDK I already had for Eclipse, then:


Started a new project
Set minimum SDK 4.0 (API Level 14)
Choose Blank Activity option
Used Default names for Activity Name and Layout Name
Hit Finish


After a few seconds Gradle finishes the build, and it throws me two errors with the following messages in file Teste4\\app\\build\\intermediates/exploded-aar\\com.android.support\\appcompat-v7\\23.0.0\\res\\values-v23\\values-v23.xml:


  Error:(2) Error retrieving parent for item: No resource found that matches the given name 'android:TextAppearance.Material.Widget.Button.Inverse'. 
    
  Error:(2) Error retrieving parent for item: No resource found that matches the given name 'android:Widget.Material.Button.Colored'. 


Under File -> Project Structure -> Modules: app (left column) -> Properties tab, I have the following versions set up:


"Compile Sdk Version": Android 5.1 (API Level 22)
"Build Tools Version": 23.0.2


What should I do in order to fix this?

I already tried what was suggested in Stack Overflow question appcompat-v7:21.0.0': No resource found that matches the given name: attr 'android:actionModeShareDrawable', but it didn't work.

A:Your compile SDK version must match the support library's major version.

Since you are using version 23 of the support library, you need to compile against version 23 of the Android SDK.

Alternatively you can continue compiling against version 22 of the Android SDK by switching to the latest support library v22.
