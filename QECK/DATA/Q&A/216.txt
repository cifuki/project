Q:I spent quite sometime figuring how to set up adb on Mac, so I figure writing how to set it up might be useful to some people. adb is the command line tool to install and run android apps on your phone/emulator

A:Note: this was originally written on Installing ADB on MAC OS X but that question was closed as a duplicate of this one.

Option 1 - Using Homebrew

This is the easiest way and will provide automatic updates.


Install homebrew

ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

Install adb 

brew cask install android-platform-tools

Start using adb

adb devices





Option 2 - Manually (just the platform tools)

This is the easiest way to get a manual installation of ADB and Fastboot. 


Delete your old installation (optional) 

rm -rf ~/.android-sdk-macosx/

Navigate to https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools.html and click on the SDK Platform-Tools for Mac link. 
Go to your Downloads folder

cd ~/Downloads/

Unzip the tools you downloaded

unzip platform-tools-latest*.zip 

Move them somewhere you won't accidentally delete them

mkdir ~/.android-sdk-macosx
mv platform-tools/ ~/.android-sdk-macosx/platform-tools

Add platform-tools to your path

echo 'export PATH=$PATH:~/.android-sdk-macosx/platform-tools/' >> ~/.bash_profile

Refresh your bash profile (or restart your terminal app)

source ~/.bash_profile

Start using adb

adb devices



Option 3 - If you already have Android Studio installed


Add platform-tools to your path

echo 'export ANDROID_HOME=/Users/$USER/Library/Android/sdk' >> ~/.bash_profile
echo 'export PATH=${PATH}:$ANDROID_HOME/tools:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools' >> ~/.bash_profile

Refresh your bash profile (or restart your terminal app)

source ~/.bash_profile

Start using adb

adb devices



Option 4 - MacPorts


Install the Android SDK:

sudo port install android

Run the SDK manager:

sh /opt/local/share/java/android-sdk-macosx/tools/android

Uncheck everything but Android SDK Platform-tools (optional)
Install the packages, accepting licenses. Close the SDK Manager.
Add platform-tools to your path; in MacPorts, they're in /opt/local/share/java/android-sdk-macosx/platform-tools.  E.g., for bash:

echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/opt/local/share/java/android-sdk-macosx/platform-tools' >> ~/.bash_profile

Refresh your bash profile (or restart your terminal/shell):

source ~/.bash_profile

Start using adb:

adb devices



Option 5 - Manually (with SDK Manager)


Delete your old installation (optional) 

rm -rf ~/.android-sdk-macosx/

Download the Mac SDK Tools from the Android developer site under "Get just the command line tools". Make sure you save them to your Downloads folder.
Go to your Downloads folder

cd ~/Downloads/

Unzip the tools you downloaded

unzip tools_r*-macosx.zip 

Move them somewhere you won't accidentally delete them

mkdir ~/.android-sdk-macosx
mv tools/ ~/.android-sdk-macosx/tools

Run the SDK Manager

sh ~/.android-sdk-macosx/tools/android

Uncheck everything but Android SDK Platform-tools (optional)





Click Install Packages, accept licenses, click Install. Close the SDK Manager window.





Add platform-tools to your path

echo 'export PATH=$PATH:~/.android-sdk-macosx/platform-tools/' >> ~/.bash_profile

Refresh your bash profile (or restart your terminal app)

source ~/.bash_profile

Start using adb

adb devices
