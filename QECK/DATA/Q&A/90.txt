Q:I have Windows 8.1 pro with an AMD processor. I installed the Android SDK and Eclipse. It works but the problem is that when I Create AVD and launch it shows this error:


  emulator: ERROR: x86 emulation currently requires hardware acceleration!
   Please ensure Intel HAXM is properly installed and usable.
   CPU acceleration status: HAX kernel module is not installed!


I have already installed Intel Hardware_Accelerated_Execution_Manager and I have enabled Virtual modulation from the boot menu, but it's still not working.

A:Make sure you have installed HAXM installer on your SDK Manager.



After you download it and make sure you run the setup located in:
{SDK_FOLDER}\\extras\\intel\\Hardware_Accelerated_Execution_Manager\\intelhaxm.exe

Note: in Android Studio, the command "intelhaxm.exe" has been changed to "intelhaxm-android.exe"

If you get the error "VT not supported" during the installation disable Hyper-V on windows features. You can execute this command dism.exe /Online /Disable-Feature:Microsoft-Hyper-V. You will also need "Virtualization Technology" to be enabled on your BIOS
