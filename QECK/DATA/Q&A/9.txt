Q:We are working on an S60 version and this platform has a nice Python API..

However, there is nothing official about Python on Android, but since Jython exists, is there a way to let the snake and the robot work together??

A:One way is to use Kivy:


  Open source Python library for rapid development of applications
  that make use of innovative user interfaces, such as multi-touch apps.





  Kivy runs on Linux, Windows, OS X, Android and iOS. You can run the same [python] code on all supported platforms.
