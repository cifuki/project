Q:In my app "Tide Now WA" which I recently tested for compatibility using
the new Nexus 9 tablet (Lollipop - API 21).

It writes some button text. This app writes the text correctly using Android 2.3 and Android
4.0. I.e. mixed capital and lower case letters. 

When same app is run on my Nexus 9 all the letters
in the text are capitalized. 

FWIW my manifest contains the following statement:

uses-sdk android:minSdkVersion="10" android:targetSdkVersion="14"

Can I fix this in my code or is it a bug in the O.S.
thanks

A:I don't have idea why it is happening but there 3 trivial attempts to make:


Use android:textAllCaps="false" in your layout-v21
Programmatically change the transformation method of the button.  mButton.setTransformationMethod(null);
Check your style for Allcaps


Note: public void setAllCaps(boolean allCaps), android:textAllCaps are available from API version 14.
