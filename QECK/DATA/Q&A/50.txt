Q:How do I check if a background service is running?

I want an Android activity that toggles the state of the service -- it lets me turn it on if it is off and off if it is on.

A:I had the same problem not long ago. Since my service was local, I ended up simply using a static field in the service class to toggle state, as described by hackbod here

EDIT (for the record):

Here is the solution proposed by hackbod:


  If your client and server code is part of the same .apk and you are 
  binding to the service with a concrete Intent (one that specifies the 
  exact service class), then you can simply have your service set a 
  global variable when it is running that your client can check. 
  
  We deliberately don't have an API to check whether a service is 
  running because, nearly without fail, when you want to do something 
  like that you end up with race conditions in your code.
