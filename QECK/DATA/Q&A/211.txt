Q:I want to automatically show the soft-keyboard when an EditText is focused (if the device does not have a physical keyboard) and I have two problems:


When my Activity is displayed, my EditText is focused but the keyboard is not displayed, I need to click again on it to show the keyboard (it should be displayed when my Activity is displayed).
And when I click done on the keyboard, the keyboard is dissmissed but the EditText stays focused and y don't want (because my edit is done).


To resume, my problem is to have something more like on the iPhone: which keep the keyboard sync with my EditText state (focused / not focused) and of course does not present a soft-keyboard if there is a physical one.

A:To force the soft keyboard to appear, you can use

EditText yourEditText= (EditText) findViewById(R.id.yourEditText);
InputMethodManager imm = (InputMethodManager) getSystemService(Context.INPUT_METHOD_SERVICE);
imm.showSoftInput(yourEditText, InputMethodManager.SHOW_IMPLICIT);


And for removing the focus on EditText, sadly you need to have a dummy View to grab focus.

I hope this helps



To close it you can use

InputMethodManager imm = (InputMethodManager) getSystemService(Context.INPUT_METHOD_SERVICE);
imm.hideSoftInputFromWindow(yourEditText.getWindowToken(), 0);




This works for using it in a dialog

public void showKeyboard(){
    InputMethodManager inputMethodManager = (InputMethodManager) context.getSystemService(Context.INPUT_METHOD_SERVICE);
    inputMethodManager.toggleSoftInput(InputMethodManager.SHOW_FORCED, 0);
}

public void closeKeyboard(){
    InputMethodManager inputMethodManager = (InputMethodManager) context.getSystemService(Context.INPUT_METHOD_SERVICE);
    inputMethodManager.toggleSoftInput(InputMethodManager.HIDE_IMPLICIT_ONLY, 0);
}
