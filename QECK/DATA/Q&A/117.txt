Q:I get the following Exception running my app:

java.net.SocketException: Permission denied (maybe missing INTERNET permission)


How do I solve the missing permission problem?

A:Update:
Google removed the need to ask permission for the internet for the latest version of Google Play. 


  Add the [INTERNET][1] permission to your manifest file.
  
  You have to add this line: 

<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" /> 

  
  outside the application tag in your AndroidManifest.xml
