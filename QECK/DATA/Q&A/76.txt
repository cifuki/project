Q:I am trying to work on sending an object of my customer class from one Activity and display it in another Activity.

The code for the customer class:

public class Customer {

    private String firstName, lastName, Address;
    int Age;

    public Customer(String fname, String lname, int age, String address) {

        firstName = fname;
        lastName = lname;
        Age = age;
        Address = address;
    }

    public String printValues() {

        String data = null;

        data = "First Name :" + firstName + " Last Name :" + lastName
        + " Age : " + Age + " Address : " + Address;

        return data;
    }
}


I want to send its object from one Activity to another and then display the data on the other Activity.

How can I achieve that?

A:One option could be letting your custom class implement the Serializable interface and then you can pass object instances in the intent extra using the putExtra(Serializable..) variant of the Intent#putExtra() method.

Pseudocode:

//To pass:
intent.putExtra("MyClass", obj);

// To retrieve object in second Activity
getIntent().getSerializableExtra("MyClass");


Note: Make sure each nested class of your main custom class has implemented Serializable interface to avoid any serialization exceptions. For example: 

class MainClass implements Serializable {

    public MainClass() {}

    public static class ChildClass implements Serializable {

        public ChildClass() {}
    }
}
