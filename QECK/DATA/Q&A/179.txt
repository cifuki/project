Q:This must come up very often.

When the user is editing preferences in an Android app, I'd like them to be able to see the currently set value of the preference in the Preference summary.

Example: if I have a Preference setting for "Discard old messages" that specifies the number of days after which messages need to be cleaned up. In the PreferenceActivity I'd like the user to see:

"Discard old messages" <- title

"Clean up messages after x days" <- summary where x is the current Preference value 

Extra credit: make this reusable, so I can easily apply it to all my preferences regardless of their type (so that it work with EditTextPreference, ListPreference etc. with minimal amount of coding).

A:There are ways to make this a more generic solution, if that suits your needs.

For example, if you want to generically have all list preferences show their choice as summary, you could have this for your onSharedPreferenceChanged implementation:

public void onSharedPreferenceChanged(SharedPreferences sharedPreferences, String key) {
    Preference pref = findPreference(key);

    if (pref instanceof ListPreference) {
        ListPreference listPref = (ListPreference) pref;
        pref.setSummary(listPref.getEntry());
    }
}


This is easily extensible to other preference classes.

And by using the getPreferenceCount and getPreference functionality in PreferenceScreen and PreferenceCategory, you could easily write a generic function to walk the preference tree setting the summaries of all preferences of the types you desire to their toString representation
