Q:Is it possible to implement the model\xe2\x80\x93view\xe2\x80\x93controller pattern in Java for Android?

Or is it already implemented through Activities? Or is there a better way to implement the MVC pattern for Android?

A:In Android you don't have MVC, but you have the following:


You define your user interface in  various XML files by resolution, hardware, etc.
You define your resources in various XML files by locale, etc.
You extend clases like ListActivity, TabActivity and make use of the XML file by inflaters.
You can create as many classes as you wish for your business logic.
A lot of Utils have been already written for you - DatabaseUtils, Html.
