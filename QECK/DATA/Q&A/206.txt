Q:When I develop the project using Eclipse, the APK file goes on the emulator. But I want to upload my application to a real device.  Is there a tool to build an APK file?

What is the process? Or is it possible to pull the APK file from the emulator?

A:When you run the project on the emulator, the APK file is generated in the bin directory. Keep in mind that just building the project (and not running it) will not output the APK file into the bin directory.
