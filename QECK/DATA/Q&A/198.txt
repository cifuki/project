Q:I am wondering if there is a way to handle the user pressing Enter while typing in an EditText, something like the onSubmit HTML event.

Also wondering if there is a way to manipulate the virtual keyboard in such a way that the "Done" button is labeled something else (for example "Go") and performs a certain action when clicked (again, like onSubmit).

Yes.

Also yes.

You will want to look at the android:imeActionId and android:imeOptions attributes, plus the setOnEditorActionListener() method, all on TextView.

For changing the text of the "Done" button to a custom string, use: 

mEditText.setImeActionLabel("Custom text", KeyEvent.KEYCODE_ENTER);
