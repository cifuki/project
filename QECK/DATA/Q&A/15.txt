Q:I'm a little confused about two XML properties: match_parent and fill_parent. It seems that both are the same. Is there any difference between them?

A:They're the same thing (in API Level 8+). Use match_parent.


  FILL_PARENT (renamed MATCH_PARENT in API Level 8 and higher), which means that the view wants to be as big as its parent (minus padding)
  
  ...
  
  fill_parent: The view should be as big as its parent (minus padding). This constant is deprecated starting from API Level 8 and is replaced by match_parent.
