Q:I'm trying to install the Android SDK on my Windows 7 x64 System. jdk-6u23-windows-x64.exe is installed, but the Android SDK setup refuses to proceed because it doesn't find the JDK installation.

Is this a known issue? And is there a solution?

A:Press Back when you get the notification and then Next. This time it will find the JDK.
