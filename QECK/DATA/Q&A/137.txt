Q:I'm trying to have an image (as the background) on a button and add dynamically, depending on what's happening during run-time, some text above/over the image.

If I use ImageButton I don't even have the possibility to add text.
If I use Button I can add text but only define an image with android:drawableBottom and similar XML attributes as defined here.

However these attributes only combine text & image in x- and y-dimensions, meaning I can draw an image around my text, but not below/under my text (with the z-axis defined as coming out of the display).

Any suggestions on how to do this? One idea would be to either extend Button or ImageButton and override the draw()-method. But with my current level of knowledge I don't really know how to do this (2D rendering). Maybe someone with more experience knows a solution or at least some pointers to start?

A:You can call setBackground() on a Button to set the background of the button.

Any text will appear above the background.

If you are looking for something similar in xml there is:
android:background attribute which works the same way.
