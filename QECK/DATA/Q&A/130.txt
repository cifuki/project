Q:Intent intent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_SEND);
intent.setType("text/html");
intent.putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_EMAIL, "emailaddress@emailaddress.com");
intent.putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_SUBJECT, "Subject");
intent.putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_TEXT, "I'm email body.");

startActivity(Intent.createChooser(intent, "Send Email"));


The above code opens a dialog showing following apps:- Bluetooth, Google Docs, Yahoo Mail, Gmail, Orkut, Skype etc.

Actually, I want to filter these list-options. I want to show only email related apps e.g. Gmail, Yahoo Mail. How to do it?

I've seen such example on 'Android Market' application. 


Open Android Market app 
Open any application where developer has specified his/her email address. (If you can't find such app just open my app:- market://details?id=com.becomputer06.vehicle.diary.free , OR search by 'Vehicle Diary')
Scroll down to 'DEVELOPER'
Click on 'Send Email'


The dialog shows only email Apps e.g. Gmail, Yahoo Mail etc. It does not show Bluetooth, Orkut etc. What code produces such dialog?

A:when you will change your  intent.setType like below you will get

intent.setType("text/plain");


Use android.content.Intent.ACTION_SENDTO to get only the list of e-mail clients, with no facebook or other apps. Just the email clients.
Ex:

new Intent(Intent.ACTION_SENDTO);


I wouldn't suggest you get directly to the email app. Let the user choose his favorite email app. Don't constrain him.

If you use ACTION_SENDTO, putExtra does not work to add subject and text to the intent. Use Uri to add the subject and body text.

EDIT:
We can use message/rfc822 instead of "text/plain" as the MIME type. However, that is not indicating "only offer email clients" -- it indicates "offer anything that supports message/rfc822 data". That could readily include some application that are not email clients. 

message/rfc822 supports MIME Types of .mhtml, .mht, .mime
