Q:I'm getting this error from time to time and don't know what causing this:
When trying to run/debug an Android app on a real device (Galaxy Samsung S in my case) I'm getting the following error in the Console:  


  Failed to install *.apk on device *: 
  
  timeout   Launch canceled!


This is all the Console is telling me. LogCat doesn't provide any information. Eclipse Problems view is not showing any issues. 

I tried the following steps with no success:
1. Cleaning the project (Project->Clean)
2. Restarting device, Eclipse, laptop, all of the above...
3. Moving the project to a location without spaces, according to Failed to install apk on device 'emulator-5554': timeout   

The app has been debugged in the past on that device many times (app is live on Market), but this problem happens every so often, and is VERY FRUSTRATING...

Any help would be greatly appreciated! Thanks.

A:Try changing the ADB connection timeout.  I think it defaults that to 5000ms and I changed mine to 10000ms to get rid of that problem.

If you are in Eclipse, you can do this by going through

Window -> Preferences -> Android -> DDMS -> ADB Connection Timeout (ms)
