Q:With new android API 22 getResources().getDrawable() is now deprecated.
Now the best approach is to use only getDrawable().

What changed?

A:You have some options to handle this deprecation the right (and future proof) way, depending on which kind of drawable you are loading:



A) drawables with theme attributes

ContextCompat.getDrawable(getActivity(), R.drawable.name);


You'll obtain a styled Drawable as your Activity theme instructs.
This is probably what you need.



B) drawables without theme attributes

ResourcesCompat.getDrawable(getResources(), R.drawable.name, null);


You'll get your unstyled drawable the old way. Please note: ResourcesCompat.getDrawable() is not deprecated!



EXTRA) drawables with theme attributes from another theme

ResourcesCompat.getDrawable(getResources(), R.drawable.name, anotherTheme);
