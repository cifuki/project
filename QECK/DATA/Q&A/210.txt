Q:Update: GCM is deprecated, use FCM


I'm implementing the new Google Cloud Messaging following the guides from the Google Developers page here

I've successfully run and test it. But my problem now is I have different product flavors with different applicationId/packageName and different Google Cloud Messaging Project Id. The google-services.json have to be put at the /app/google-services.json not the flavors folder.

Is there any way to make the google-services.json config different for many flavors?

A:Google included support for flavors in version 2.0 of the play services plugin. Since this version of the gradle plugin com.google.gms:google-services:2.0.0-alpha3

you can do this

app/src/
    flavor1/google-services.json
    flavor2/google-services.json


Version 3.0.0 of the plugin searches for the json file in these locations (considering you have a flavor flavor1 and a build type debug):

/app/src/flavor1/google-services.json
/app/src/flavor1/debug/google-services.json
/app/src/debug/google-services.json
/app/src/debug/flavor1/google-services.json
/app/google-services.json


This worked for me even using flavorDimensions. I have free & paid in one dimension and Mock & Prod in the other dimension. I also have 3 buildTypes: debug, release and staging. This is how it looks in my project for the FreeProd flavor:



How many google-services.json files will depend on your project's characteristics, but you will need at least one json file for every Google  project.
