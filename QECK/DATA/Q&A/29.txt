Q:I just downloaded and installed the new Android SDK. I wanted to create a simple application to test drive it.

The wizard created this code:

package eu.mauriziopz.gps;

import android.app.Activity;
import android.os.Bundle;

public class ggps extends Activity {
    /** Called when the activity is first created. */
    @Override
    public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.main);
    }
}


but Eclipse gives me the error


  R cannot be resolved


on line

setContentView(R.layout.main);


Why?

PS: I do have an XML file named main.xml under res/layout/.

A:After tracking down this problem as well, I found this note in the Android documentation:

http://source.android.com/source/using-eclipse.html


  *Note: Eclipse sometimes likes to add an "import android.R" statement at the
  top of your files that use resources,
  especially when you ask Eclipse to
  sort or otherwise manage imports. This
  will cause your make to break. Look
  out for these erroneous import
  statements and delete them.*


While going through the Android sample tutorials, I would often use the Ctrl + Shift + O command to "Organize Imports" and generate any missing import statements. Sometimes this would generate the incorrect import statement which would hide the R.java class that is automatically generated when you build.
