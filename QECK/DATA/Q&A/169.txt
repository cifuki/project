Q:Does anyone know how can I check the system version (e.g. 1.0, 2.2, etc.) programatically?

A:Check android.os.Build.VERSION.


  
  CODENAME: The current development codename, or the string "REL" if this is a release build.
  INCREMENTAL:  The internal value used by the underlying source control to represent this build.
  RELEASE:  The user-visible version string.
