Q:What is the difference between getContext() , getApplicationContext() , getBaseContext() , and "this"? 

Though this is simple question I am unable to understand the basic difference between them. Please give some easy examples if possible.

A:View.getContext():  Returns the context the view is currently running in.  Usually the currently active Activity.
Activity.getApplicationContext():  Returns the context for the entire application (the process all the Activities are running inside
of).  Use this instead of the current Activity context if you need a
context tied to the lifecycle of the entire application, not just the
current Activity.
ContextWrapper.getBaseContext():  If you need access to a Context from within another context, you use a ContextWrapper.  The
Context referred to from inside that ContextWrapper is accessed via
getBaseContext().
