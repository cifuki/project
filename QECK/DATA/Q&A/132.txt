Q:Has anyone using RecyclerView found a way to set an onClickListener to items in the RecyclerView?
I thought of setting a listener to each of the layouts for each item but that seems a little too much hassle
I'm sure there is a way for the RecyclerView to listen for the onClick event but I can't quite figure it out.

A:As the API's have radically changed, It wouldn't surprise me if you were to create an OnClickListener for each item. It isn't that much of a hassle though. In your implementation of RecyclerView.Adapter<MyViewHolder>, you should have: 

private final OnClickListener mOnClickListener = new MyOnClickListener();

@Override
public MyViewHolder onCreateViewHolder(final ViewGroup parent, final int viewType) {
    View view = LayoutInflater.from(mContext).inflate(R.layout.myview, parent, false);
    view.setOnClickListener(mOnClickListener);
    return new MyViewHolder(view);
}


The onClick method:

@Override
public void onClick(final View view) {
    int itemPosition = mRecyclerView.getChildLayoutPosition(view);
    String item = mList.get(itemPosition);
    Toast.makeText(mContext, item, Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();
}
