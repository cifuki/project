Q:In my activity, I'm calling a second activity from the main activity by startActivityForResult. In my second activity there are some methods that finish this activity (maybe without result), however, just one of them return a result.

For example, from the main activity I call a second one. In this activity I'm checking some features of handset such as does it have a camera. If it doesn't have then I'll close this activity. Also, during preparation of MediaRecorder or MediaPlayer if a problem happens then I'll close this activity.

If its device has a camera and recording is done completely, then after recording a video if a user clicks on the done button then I'll send the result (address of the recorded video) back to main activity.

How do I check the result from the main activity?

A:From your FirstActivity call the SecondActivity using  startActivityForResult() method

For example:

Intent i = new Intent(this, SecondActivity.class);
startActivityForResult(i, 1);


In your SecondActivity set the data which you want to return back to FirstActivity. If you don't want to return back, don't set any.

For example: In SecondActivity if you want to send back data:

Intent returnIntent = new Intent();
returnIntent.putExtra("result",result);
setResult(Activity.RESULT_OK,returnIntent);
finish();


If you don't want to return data:

Intent returnIntent = new Intent();
setResult(Activity.RESULT_CANCELED, returnIntent);
finish();


Now in your FirstActivity class write following code for the onActivityResult() method.

@Override
protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {

    if (requestCode == 1) {
        if(resultCode == Activity.RESULT_OK){
            String result=data.getStringExtra("result");
        }
        if (resultCode == Activity.RESULT_CANCELED) {
            //Write your code if there's no result
        }
    }
}//onActivityResult
