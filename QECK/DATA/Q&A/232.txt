Q:I've thought of some less than elegant ways to solve this, but I know I must be missing something.

My onItemSelected fires off immediately without any interaction with the user, and this is undesired behavior.  I wish for the UI to wait until the user selects something before it does anything.

I even tried setting up the listener in the onResume(), hoping that would help, but it doesn't.

How can I stop this from firing off before the user can touch the control?

public class CMSHome extends Activity { 

private Spinner spinner;

@Override
    public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    setContentView(R.layout.main);

    // Heres my spinner ///////////////////////////////////////////
    spinner = (Spinner) findViewById(R.id.spinner);
    ArrayAdapter<CharSequence> adapter = ArrayAdapter.createFromResource(
            this, R.array.pm_list, android.R.layout.simple_spinner_item);
    adapter.setDropDownViewResource(android.R.layout.simple_spinner_dropdown_item);
    spinner.setAdapter(adapter);
    };

public void onResume() {
    super.onResume();
    spinner.setOnItemSelectedListener(new MyOnItemSelectedListener());
}

    public class MyOnItemSelectedListener implements OnItemSelectedListener {

    public void onItemSelected(AdapterView<?> parent,
        View view, int pos, long id) {

     Intent i = new Intent(CMSHome.this, ListProjects.class);
     i.putExtra("bEmpID", parent.getItemAtPosition(pos).toString());
        startActivity(i);

        Toast.makeText(parent.getContext(), "The pm is " +
          parent.getItemAtPosition(pos).toString(), Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();
    }

    public void onNothingSelected(AdapterView parent) {
      // Do nothing.
    }
}
}

A:I would have expected your solution to work -- I though the selection event would not fire if you set the adapter before setting up the listener.

That being said, a simple boolean flag would allow you to detect the rogue first selection event and ignore it.
