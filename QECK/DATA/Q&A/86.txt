Q:I would like to draw a line right in the middle of a layout and use it as a separator of other items like TextView. Is there a good widget for this.  I don't really want to use an image as it would be hard to match the other components to it.  And I want it to be relatively positioned as well.  Thanks

A:I usually use this code to add horizontal line:

<View
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="1dp"
    android:background="@android:color/darker_gray"/>


To add vertical separator, switch the layout_width and layout_height values
