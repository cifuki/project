Q:I finally managed to obfuscate my Android application, now I want to test it by installing the APK file and running it on the emulator.                                  

How can I install an APK file on the Android Emulator?

A:You can simply drag and drop the .apk file of your application to the emulator and it will automatically starts installing.

Another options:



Windows:


Execute the emulator (SDK Manager.exe->Tools->Manage AVDs...->New then Start)
Start the console (Windows XP), Run -> type cmd, and move to the platform-tools folder of SDK directory. 
Paste the APK file in the 'android-sdk\\tools' or 'platform-tools' folder.
Then type the following command.


  adb install [.apk path]


Example:


  adb install C:\\Users\\Name\\MyProject\\build\\Jorgesys.apk



Linux:


Copy the apk file to platform-tools in android-sdk linux folder.
Open Terminal and navigate to platform-tools folder in android-sdk.
Then Execute this command - 


  ./adb install FileName.apk

If the operation is successful (the result is displayed on the screen), then you will find your file in the launcher of your emulator.


Mac:

PATH=$PATH:~/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools



  Example : PATH=$PATH:/users/jorgesys/eclipse/android-sdk-mac_64/tools


Then run adb.

Mac:

1.Run the emulator,

2.then copy your .apk file and paste into /Users/your_system_username/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools,
if you are not able to find sdk path in your mac system, do the following steps: Open finder->select Go option on top menu -> select Go to Folder option -> it will popup a window with a textfield:  /Users/your_system_username/Library/Android/sdk/ -> now open platform-tools folder and paste your copied .apk file,


Now open terminal and type the following:
cd Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools
execute the following in your terminal: ./adb install yourapkfilename.apk  if you get the following error message: error: no devices found - waiting for device, follow the step 5.
Run your emulator from Android Studio, once emulator active then repeat step 4, you will see the success message on your terminal.
