A:To do this in the layout.xml file:

android:textStyle


Examples:

android:textStyle="bold|italic"


Programmatically the method is:

setTypeface(Typeface tf)


Sets the typeface and style in which the text should be displayed. Note that not all Typeface families actually have bold and italic variants, so you may need to use setTypeface(Typeface, int) to get the appearance that you actually want.
