Q:If your application requires a database and it comes with built in data, what is the best way to ship that application? Should I:


Precreate the SQLite database and include it in the .apk?
Include the SQL commands with the application and have it create the database and insert the data on first use?


The drawbacks I see are:


Possible SQLite version mismatches might cause problems and I currently don't know where the database should go and how to access it.
It may take a really long time to create and populate the database on the device.


Any suggestions? Pointers to the documentation regarding any issues would be greatly appreciated.

A:I just found a way to do this in ReignDesign blog in an article titled Using your own SQLite database in Android applications. Basically you precreate your database, put it in your assets directory in your apk, and on first use copy to /data/data/YOUR_PACKAGE/databases/ directory.
