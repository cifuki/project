A:Code:

TelephonyManager tMgr = (TelephonyManager)mAppContext.getSystemService(Context.TELEPHONY_SERVICE);
String mPhoneNumber = tMgr.getLine1Number();


Required Permission:

<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE"/> 


Caveats:

According to the highly upvoted comments, there are a few caveats to be aware of. This can return null or "" or even "???????", and it can return a stale phone number that is no longer valid. If you want something that uniquely identifies the device, you should use getDeviceId() instead.
