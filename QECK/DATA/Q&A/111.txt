A:It may be too late but for the sake of others who have the same problem, to set the height of the ImageView:

image_view.getLayoutParams().height = 20;


Hope this helps.

Important. If you're setting the height after the layout has already been 'laid out', make sure you also call:

image_view.requestLayout()
