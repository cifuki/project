Q:I know we can set the following values to the android:gravity and  android:layout_gravity properties:


center
center_vertical
center_horizontal, etc.


But I am confused regarding both of these.

What is the difference between the usage of android:gravity and android:layout_gravity?

A:Their names should help you:


android:gravity sets the gravity of the contents (i.e. its subviews) of the View it's used on.  
android:layout_gravity sets the gravity of the View or Layout relative to its parent.  


And an example is here.
