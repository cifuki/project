Q:I am using shared preference in my android app. I am using both commit() and apply() method from shared preference. When I use AVD 2.3 it shows no error, but when I run the code in AVD 2.1, apply() method shows error. 
SO what's the difference between these two? And by using only commit() can I store the preference value without any problem?

A:apply() was added in 2.3, it commits without returning a boolean indicating success or failure.

commit() returns true if the save works, false otherwise. 

apply() was added as the Android dev team noticed that almost no one took notice of the return value, so apply is faster as it is asynchronous.
